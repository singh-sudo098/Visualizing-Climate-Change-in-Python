# Visualizing-Climate-Change-in-python
This repository contains the artefacts for the implementation of a series of analysis on an integrated collection of large datasets. Specifically, we visualize the climate change over a span of more than 150 years using 4 different datasets - Global temperature Change, Global Sea level change, Arctic Sea Ice Minimum and CO2 emissions.
